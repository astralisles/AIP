# Road to bootstrapping (compiler written in AIP)

Done: `struct`, `variant`, `match`; `List<T>` (type-erased at run time), text helpers (`textLength`, `textSlice`, `textCode`, ...), file and
argument access, Unit `if` statements, deep recursion (512 MB stack). `examples/lexer` is the first compiler stage
written in AIP; `scripts\compare-lexers.ps1` checks it prints the same tokens as the C# lexer (`aip tokens <file>`)
for every `.fn` file, including its own source. It is part of `scripts\test.ps1`.

Still missing before the compiler can compile itself:
1. `.const` files (`.struct`/`.variant`/`match` are done; a match is only allowed as a whole statement or `let` value, not nested in other expressions).
2. Parser in AIP (lines to AST), then checker, then an emitter that writes the C# text.
3. (`Map` and `Set` now exist.) A way to run `dotnet publish` (a `process.run` effect) from AIP.
4. Then: C# compiler builds the AIP compiler (stage 1), stage 1 builds itself (stage 2), stage 2 output must equal stage 1.
